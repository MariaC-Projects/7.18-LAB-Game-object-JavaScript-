# 7.18-LAB-Game-object-JavaScript-
In this lab, the game object in index.js was enhanced with lives (initially 3) and coins (initially 0). A points getter returns coins * 10, playerDies() decrements lives if greater than 0, and newGame() resets lives and coins. The functionality was verified by uncommenting and running the test statements.
